# hello-world
My 1st repository...

Helle everyone!

I am old coder (Assembly, Pascal, C, and some C++ coded ages ago) with an interest in web-development (HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Angular, JavaScript), Python, Haskell, C++, Ocaml, Go, Rust, R, Machine-learning, and deep-learning. This is an attempt at taking up programming again, including learning more about these languages and concepts.

Previously, My jobs were mainly about Internetworking and Intranetworking - mainly Cisco, but also Juniper, Checkpoint FW-1 etc. My current work is focused on telemetry.
